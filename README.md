# novel_steg
An implementation of a novel method of image steganography

Original methodology laid out by Yogendra Kumar Jain and R. R. Ahirwal can be found here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.227.6386&rep=rep1&type=pdf

I initially implemented a modified version of this algorithm as my final project for my "Fundamentals of Multimedia" class in senior year of undergrad at UAlbany.  This implementation was in Python and was really slow for reasons I am embarrassed to discuss.  The new implementation has proven to be much faster so far, and I had originally started this rewrite to exercise my JS skills and also because I felt bad about how slow my previous implementation was.

Future ambitions for this project include:
- Actually getting full functionality (currently only encoding is functioning)
- Full ES6 compliance
- Better code structure (using ES6 imports/exports)
- Shiny UI
